== Project Context ==

The current state of healthcare system in the municipality of Paombong has still been facing major difficulties in consolidating data from the different barangay units into an organized and efficient system. Reporting is still manual and paper based, making it prone to error, destruction, and alteration. Consolidation of reports, computation of health indicators on different reports and report generation from various sources remains a challenge for the health workers of the municipality.


== Purpose and Description ==

Medicine Inventory feature is also available for inventory management and monitoring medicines before it runs out of stock. Report generation feature is the most essential part of this system which consolidates monthly inputs from different barangay units and provides quarter and annual reports efficiently. It could also generate custom reports from consultation, medicine inventory which gives the end-user capability to give different parameters for more specific reports.

  Every web developer today faces the challenge of checking website compatibility across a large pool of browsers and browser versions in the marketplace. Up and until now, either you could install every browser, verify the website via a visual inspection and debug with tools specialized to that browser, or you could send a URL to a third-party screenshotting service like BrowserShots for an all-in-one visual inspection. The former is messy and tedious but gives you more control and an opportunity to diagnose problems, whilst the latter is simple but slow and useless to fix the problem. Needless to say, SuperPreview is the best of both worlds.
SuperPreview as a tool allows you to compare different rendering engines in a single unified interface. Simple clicks gives you comparisons between Internet Explorer 6, the native version of Internet Explorer installed, other browsers you may have installed locally – Firefox 3.5, Safari 3, Safari 4 – and even an bitmap images of website prototypes.
